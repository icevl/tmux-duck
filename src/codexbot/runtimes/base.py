"""Base protocol for agent runtimes (Codex, Claude Code).

Phase 1 keeps the interface intentionally tiny: a runtime knows how to
produce the shell command that launches its CLI in tmux, and how to
discover the session id for a freshly created window. Later phases will
add transcript path resolution, UI patterns, and skill discovery here.
